Moore's Law: 2x transistors/chip every 1.5 years
Microprocessors have become smaller, denser, and more powerful

So the transistor density of semiconductor chips double every 18 months

Hardware-specific software:
Advantage:
Exploit hardware; fast; full functionality of device
Disadvantage:
You lose flexibility and evolv-ability and portability 

VM:
One machine appearing to be something it isn't,
Give user the illusion that they have their own machine
If it's in the cloud, it's like they're sitting on a physical machine,
even if it's only a quarter of a real machine

System VM:
Supports execution of an entire OS (like Mac or Linux), ex: VMWare
-- You can 'use' a Windows machine even if you're on Mac
-- Remote Desktop, I think

Process VM:
Supports execution of a single program; Think of the JVM (Java
Virtual Machine) ==> Same functionality running on any native operating
System, whether it be Linux, Windows, Mac,...

Each process thinks it has all memory/CPU time 
and owns all devices

Different devices appear to have same interface

Fault Isolation:
	- Processes unable to directly impact other processes
	- Bugs cannot crash whole machine

Can aid testing programs on other OSs!
